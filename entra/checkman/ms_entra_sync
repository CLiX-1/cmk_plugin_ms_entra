description:
 This check monitors the synchronization status of Microsoft Entra Connect
 or Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync. These services synchronize on-premises
 Active Directory objects with Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) to enable
 hybrid identity scenarios.

 The check processes data collected by the {Microsoft Entra} special agent,
 which queries the Microsoft Graph API to retrieve synchronization status
 information from the Entra tenant.

 The service monitors both sync enablement status and the time elapsed since
 the last successful synchronization:

 Sync enablement status:

 {UNKNOWN}: Entra Connect/Cloud Sync is not active or enabled

 Default mapping:

 {OK}: Last sync occurred within 1 hour

 {WARN}: Last sync occurred more than 1 hour ago

 {CRIT}: Last sync occurred more than 3 hours ago

 The service displays the timestamp of the last synchronization and tracks
 the elapsed time since then. Regular synchronization is critical for
 maintaining consistency between on-premises and cloud identities.

 You must configure the {Microsoft Entra} special agent to collect
 synchronization status data from your Entra tenant.

discovery:
 One service named "Entra connect sync" is created automatically if
 synchronization information is available in the Entra tenant.
