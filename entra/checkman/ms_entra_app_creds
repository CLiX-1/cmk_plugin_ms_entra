description:
 This check monitors the expiration status of secrets and certificates
 associated with Microsoft Entra app registrations. App registrations allow
 applications to authenticate with Microsoft Entra ID using client secrets
 or certificates as credentials.

 The check processes data collected by the {Microsoft Entra} special agent,
 which queries the Microsoft Graph API to retrieve credential information
 for all app registrations in the Entra tenant.

 Each app registration can have multiple credentials of the same type (secrets
 or certificates). The service monitors the credential with the earliest
 expiration time for each credential type and uses configurable thresholds
 to alert before expiration.

 Credential exclusion functionality allows administrators to ignore specific
 credentials based on regular expression patterns matching credential descriptions.
 This is useful for excluding system-managed credentials like Microsoft Entra
 Application Proxy secrets.

 Default mapping:

 {OK}: Credential expires in more than 14 days

 {WARN}: Credential expires within 14 days

 {CRIT}: Credential expires within 5 days

 For expired credentials, the service continues to report critical state and
 displays the expiration timespan as "X ago" format.

 The service details include complete app registration information such as
 app name, app ID, object ID, description, and detailed information for all
 associated credentials including IDs, descriptions, and expiration times.

 You must configure the {Microsoft Entra} special agent to collect app
 registration credential data from your Entra tenant.

item:
 The app registration name combined with the credential type, formatted as
 "{app_name} - {credential_type}". Credential types are "Secret" for client
 secrets and "Certificate" for certificates.

discovery:
 One service is created automatically for each credential type found per
 app registration. Services are named "Entra app creds {app_name} - {credential_type}"
 where separate services monitor secrets and certificates independently.
