# Checkmk Plugin: Microsoft Entra Special Agent 

The Microsoft Entra Special Agent can be integrated into Checkmk 2.3 or newer.

You can download the .mkp file from releases in this repository to upload it directly to your Checkmk site.

The Plugin provides monitoring of these components:
- Microsoft Entra connect/cloud sync

The Special Agent uses the Microsoft Graph API to collect the data.
